Performed Feature Engineering by using Exploratory Data Analysis and checked for null values and dropped them, checked for outliers via boxplot and handled them using Interquartile Range. Checked if features had correlation by heatmap and removed those features showing high correlation. Label Encoding the column headers, performed Model Building. R2 score Metric used.
